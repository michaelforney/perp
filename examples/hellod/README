hellod is a simple perpetrate service that may be useful for testing
a perp installation.

It uses tcpserver (from ucspi-tcp) listening on port 1789, the "hello"
port.  Whenever a connection is made, it execs the /bin/sh shell to
echo a greeting and the client's ip address back to the client.

Clients can connect to the hellod server with tcpcat:

  $ tcpcat 127.0.0.1 1789
  hello 127.0.0.1

or (with a properly configured /etc/services):

  $ tcpcat 127.0.0.1 hello
  hello 127.0.0.1

Netcat is another utility:

  $ nc 127.0.0.1 hello
  hello 127.0.0.1
