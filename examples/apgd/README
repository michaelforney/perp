# automatic password generation service
# wcm, 2009.12.28 - 2009.12.28

This directory contains a set of perp runscripts for a
password generator service based on apg.

It requires the apg package and the ucspi-tcp package.

The service uses tcpserver to listen and respond to queries
on port 129, the "well-known" pwdgen service port defined in
/etc/services.

Configure the POLICY variable in rc.main according to the apgd(8)
manual, to setup the desired characteristics of the generated
passwords.

Once the service is installed and running, query it for a set
of passwords with tcpcat:

  tcpcat 0 129

Other netcat-type utilities may be used instead:

  nc 0 129


NOTES:

On NetBSD systems, apgd seems to suck the entropy pool dry very
quickly!
