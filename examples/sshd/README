This directory defines a set of perp runscripts for an sshd service.

The rc.main runscript provides two methods of running sshd under
supervision:

  * sshd listens itself, runs as a persistent process
  * sshd runs once per connection under tcpserver

By default the script is setup to run with the first method, that is,
sshd itself will listen for incoming connections.  The service can
be used on a "first-boot" system and will generate the keyfiles it
needs automatically.

To run under tcpserver, copy the rc.main_tcpserver script into
rc.main.  Read the comments in the script and edit the script
accordingly.  Note also to setup the CONLIMIT variable and any
tcprules definitions in ./tcprules.  The script will rebuild
./tcprules.cdb on each run, or may be used to rebuild the the rules
at any time:

  # vi tcprules
  # ./rc.main make_rules

It is not necessary to restart the service.  The new rules will take
effect with the next incoming connection.
