# perp: persistent process supervision
# sample perp services
# wcm, 2009.12.28 - 2011.02.02
# ===

This directory contains the following sample perp services:

  apgd       automatic password generator
  dnscache   djbdns caching nameserver
  hellod     port 1789 (hello) service for testing
  mathopd    lightweight httpd server
  sshd       secure shell daemon

To install a service:

  $ su
  # cp -R apgd /etc/perp
  # chmod +x /etc/perp/apgd/rc.*

To activate a service:

  $ su
  # chmod +t /etc/perp/apgd && perphup

or (since perp-2.00):

  $ su
  # perpctl A apgd


Notes:

All services use the same generic rc.log runscript for logging
with tinylog using the tinylog_run wrapper.  A sample
tinylog.conf file is shown here, and may be edited/installed
in /etc/tinylog.conf.

The tinylog_run script is setup to run under an unprivileged
user account named `tinylog'.  The administrator will need
to add the appropriate user/group accounts to the system to
enable this feature.
