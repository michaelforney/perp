See the mathopd wiki for all details of running mathopd:

  http://www.mathopd.org/wiki

Everything is configured in the mathopd.conf file, setup in rc.main
to be local to the service directory.  The example included here
is commented for a configuration specific to running under the
supervision of perpetrate.  Key points:

  * all logging to /dev/stderr (will be picked up by tinylog)
  * no pid file necessary

The example configuration included here also shows running mathopd
under a non-privileged user "mathopd".  Such account will need to
be added to the system before starting this service.

Note that mathopd may be configured from stdin, so that all
configuration could be done within the runscript itself.  The
mathopd documentation suggests that this feature is deprecated.
